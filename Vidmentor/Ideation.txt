Problem Statement?

	1.what is the problem?
		Today's Online platforms provides Vast Educational contents or videos but learners faces difficulty 	in finding the right videos for their learning styles and for their preferences.

	2.Who is affected?
		-College Students
		-Self-learners
		-Beginners trying to learn new concepts

	3.why current solutions fails?
		Most of the online educational platforms focuses most on popularity and engagement not for the educational relevance. like:
			- Suggests videos based on views and watch time.
			- Does not consider student background, difficulty level or on learning goals
			- Lacks structured feedback-based personalization for education
		This leads to mismatched content and inefficient learning.

Proposed Idea:

	The proposed system aims to build a Personalized video recommendation system using student profiles and online video data.
		- Collects student profile and preferences
		- Retrieve educational videos using APIs
		- Matches videos using content-based and feedback-driven algorithms.
		- Improves Recommendations over a time using feedback from the learner.

	This approach helps students learn efficiently, save time and receive relevant educational content instead of random video suggestions.
